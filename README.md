## Features

This add-on, of course, provides an SSH server, based on [OpenSSH][openssh].
Additionally, it comes out of the box with the following:

- A secure default configuration of SSH:
  - Only allows login by the configured user, even if more users are created.
  - Only uses known secure ciphers and algorithms.
  - Limits login attempts to hold of brute-force attacks better.
  - Many more security tweaks, *this addon passes all [ssh-audit] checks
    without warnings!*

- Port number is configurable (You could use `1982` instead of port `22`).
- SFTP support is disabled by default but is user configurable.
- Username is configurable, so `root` is no longer mandatory.
- Debug mode for allowing you to triage issues easier.
- Compatible if Hass.io was installed via the generic Linux installer.
- Have Alpine packages installed on start. This will allow you to install your
favorite tools, which will be available every single time you log in.
- Execute custom commands on start automatically so that you can customize the 
shell to your likings.
- [ZSH][zsh] as its default shell. Easier to use for the beginner, more advanced
for the more experienced user. It even comes preloaded with 
["Oh My ZSH"][ohmyzsh], with some plugins enabled as well.
- Contains a sensible set of tools right out of the box: curl, Wget, RSync, GIT,
Nmap, Mosquitto client, MariaDB/MySQL client, Awake (“wake on LAN”), Nano, Vim,
tmux, and a bunch commonly used networking tools.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straight forward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. If you installed the "SSH server" add-on from the built-in add-on, then
    remove that one first.
2. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.  
    **NOTE**: Do not add this repository, but use:
    `https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.
3. Install the "SSH - Secure Shell" add-on from our repository
5. Start the "SSH - Secure Shell" add-on
6. Check the logs of the "SSH - Secure Shell" add-on to see if everything
    went well.

Please read the rest of this document further instructions.

## Configuration

_Please remember to restart the add-on when the configuration changes._

Example add-on configuration:
```json
{
  "debug": true,
  "port": 22,
  "username": "hass",
  "password": "",
  "authorized_keys": [
    "ssh-rsa AASDJKJKJFWJFAFLCNALCMLAK234234....."
  ],
  "sftp": false,
  "packages": [
    "python",
    "python-dev",
    "py-pip",
    "build-base"
  ],
  "init_commands": [
    "pip install virtualenv",
    "pip install yamllint"
  ]
}
```
_*Note*: This is just an example, don't copy and past it! Create your own!_

**Option: `debug`**

When set to `true` the addon will output more information in the logs of the
add-on. The add-on will also start the SSH daemon in debug mode. While SSH is
running in daemon mode, it will be only able to accept one single connection. As
soon as this session is ended, the addon will stop running.

This might be useful when you are dealing with an unknown issue. It is
recommended leaving to option set to `false`, unless you are troubleshooting.

**Option: `port`**

The default port for SSH is `22`, some security guides recommend to
change the port to something else. Sometimes you'd just like to have it on
another port. Remember, if you change to port, be sure it is not in use 
already!

**Option: `username`**

This option allows you to change to username the use when you log in via SSH.
It is only utilized for the authentication; you will be the `root` user after
you have authenticated. Using `root` as the username is possible, but not
recommended.

_*Note*: Due to limitations, you will need to set this option to `root` in
order to be able to enable the SFTP capabilities._

**Option: `password`**

Sets the password to log in with. Leaving it empty would disable the possibility
to authenticate with a password. We would highly recommend not to use this
option from a security point of view.

**Option: `authorized_keys`**

Add one or more public keys to your SSH server to use with authentication.
This is the recommended over setting a password.

Please take a look at the awesome [documentation created by GitHub][github-ssh]
about using public/private key pairs and how to create them.

**Option: `sftp`**

When set to `true` the addon will enable SFTP support on the SSH daemon.
Please only enable it when you plan to use it.

_*Note*: Due to limitations, you will need to set the username to `root` in
order to be able to enable the SFTP capabilities._

**Option: `packages`**

Allows you to specify additional [Alpine packages][alpine-packages] to be 
installed in your shell environment (e.g., Python, Joe, Irssi).

_*Note*: Adding many packages will result in a longer start-up 
time for the add-on._

**Option: `init_commands`**

Customize your shell environment even more with the `init_commands` option.
Add one or more shell commands to the list, and they will be executed every
single time this add-on starts. 

## Known issues and limitations

- When SFTP is enabled, the username MUST be set to `root`. 

## Support

  an excellent home automation toolkit

Thank you all!
